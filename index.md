# Garden Monitoring system
This project will detect whether plants need water or if they have enough water. If the plant has enough water there is no need to over fill it when the light sensor comes on. If it is dry then the light sensor will detect water is needed and then you should water your plant and not leave it dry.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up my esp and getting the esp to work then I went to work on my moisture sensor to code all the necessary components in the processof working. I also finished my Oled display soldering and now I am getting ready to code it once I figure out the main code to connect it to the water sensor I should be finished. Before I was able to get all of this program my Arduino was fried and that was a major setback then, my usb serial ports were blocked by my schools admin. Since then I got the serial ports unlocked and now I will be able to code and so my Final project shall be done soon. Once the OLED display is finsihed, I shall work on my next milestone.
